      <li>Alexander Li, Sophomore, either Psychology or Digital Studies</li>
      <li>Because I'm thinking of majoring in Digital Studies</li>
      <li>I've taken programming classes in high school, and also took the AP Computer Science exam.</li>
      <li>To gain profiency in more programming languages</li>
      <li>First activity: In the Command Line activity, I opened up Terminal and learned
        about what it could do, such as creating documents and organizing files.
        I typed in some basic commands next to the command prompt to see how Terminal
        responded to them. For example, the command whoami causes Terminal to return the username.
        The command cd changes directories, with cd ~/ being the command to return to the home directory,
        and can also be used to create new ones. I also created new files using the editor Vim,
        during which I also switched between command and insert mode to save changes to the file
        and add text to the file respectively.
        <br><br>
        Second activity: In the File organization and naming conventions activity,
        I read about good rules to follow while naming files, such as being specific so
        you can know exactly what’s in the file just by reading the name, using dates or numbers
        denoting the version rather than just putting a “New” at the front of the file name
        so you can more easily tell when the file was made/which is the newest version of the file,
        and also not using abbreviations in case you forget what the abbreviation stood for.
        Additionally, I read about the different types of naming styles one can use while naming
        their files, such as PascalCase, snake_case, and SCREAMING_CASE.
        <br><br>
        Third activity: The Filesystem activity taught me the proper definitions for files,
        folders, and programs. From it, I also learned what a permission set is: 3 sets of 3 letters that determine
        whether the user/user group/everyone is allowed to read/write/execute a file. I went into my Finder and found
        out where I could access the permissions to my files and that I could make my home directory more accessible
        by putting it in the sidebar. I also went into Terminal, where I entered the command that would list all the
        files in my directories, as well as the command to list all the files and hidden files in my directories.</li>
      <li>First project: The Wiki Game
        <br>https://www.thewikigame.com/group
        <br>This is a game that sends you to a random Wikipedia page and gives
         you a second one you need to open just by clicking hyperlinks on the
        current article. What I find remarkable about this game is the creativity
        in taking a website not designed for entertainment at all and creating a game out of it.
        <br><br>
        Second project: This Person Does Not Exist
        <br>https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/
        <br>This website generates realistic-looking human faces, and is part of a series
        of websties that generate fake images of things, like chemicals, horses, and voices.
        It accomplishes this through the use of the generative adversarial network.
        I find this one remarkable in particular because the faces really do look like they were
        from real photos, and the fact that the network is able to generate a new one every time one
        refreshes is very impressive.
        <br><br>
        Third project: stickyscreen.org
        <br>https://stickyscreen.org/
        <br>This website has a single post-it note that one can type reminders for themselves
        onto like an actual post-it note. They can then set the website as their homepage so
        they can see the reminder whenever they click the home button. I found this website remarkable
        because while it's simple, it's also extremely helpful nonetheless in our everyday lives.</li>
