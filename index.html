      <li>First project: The Wiki Game, https://www.thewikigame.com/group,
        This is a game that sends you to a random Wikipedia page and gives
         you a second one you need to open just by clicking hyperlinks on the
        current article. What I find remarkable about this game is the creativity
        in taking a website not designed for entertainment at all and creating a game out of it.</li>
