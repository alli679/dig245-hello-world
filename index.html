      <li>Alexander Li, Sophomore, either Psychology or Digital Studies</li>
      <li>Because I'm thinking of majoring in Digital Studies</li>
      <li>I've taken programming classes in high school, and also took the AP Computer Science exam.</li>
      <li>To gain profiency in more programming languages</li>
      <li></li>
      <li>First project: The Wiki Game, https://www.thewikigame.com/group,
        This is a game that sends you to a random Wikipedia page and gives
         you a second one you need to open just by clicking hyperlinks on the
        current article. What I find remarkable about this game is the creativity
        in taking a website not designed for entertainment at all and creating a game out of it.</li>
      <li>Second project: This Person Does Not Exist, https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/,
        This website generates realistic-looking human faces, and is part of a series
        of websties that generate fake images of things, like chemicals, horses, and voices.
        It accomplishes this through the use of the generative adversarial network.
        I find this one remarkable in particular because the faces really do look like they were
        from real photos, and the fact that the network is able to generate a new one every time one
        refreshes is very impressive.
      </li>
      <li>Third project: stickyscreen.org, https://stickyscreen.org/,
        This website has a single post-it note that one can type reminders for themselves
        onto like an actual post-it note. They can then set the website as their homepage so
        they can see the reminder whenever they click the home button. I found this website remarkable
        because while it's simple, it's also extremely helpful nonetheless in our everyday lives.
